A Simple Streaming Upload Server and Client

Example

ruby uploader.rb --port 3003 --authorizer authorizer.rb --auth-url http://yourhost/check --no-auth-redirect http://yourhost/login

# this says use the built in authorizing and have it send an http request to /check
# if it gets a denied response it will redirect to /login

# remember in order for the authorizer to work, it forwards cookies, so the domain of the uploader and the domain of the check app
# need to be the same.

Dependencies:
  client must have google gears installed

  make sure to create the data-files folder

Setup

  mkdir data-files

  ruby uploader.rb -p1337 

  or to use the uploader from a static file, see views/static.html
